🔐 JWT Authentication
This project utilizes JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. Here's how it works:

Login: Users authenticate by providing their credentials (username and password).
JWT Token: On successful authentication, the server generates a JWT token and returns it to the user.
Secure Endpoints: For any secure endpoint, users must include their token in the Authorization header.
📜 API Documentation
You can interact with the API by sending requests to the following endpoints:

POST /login – Generate a JWT token after login.
GET /secure-endpoint – A secured resource, requires a valid JWT token.
For detailed API documentation, refer to Swagger or check the Postman collection (if provided).
